        <h1> Hello, My name is Ayah, I am a Junior at WECIB and this is (Not) my first HTML project
        </h1>
        <p> I really love robotics and web devlopment, I started coding for fun in 8th grade so this is my 3rd year coding<br>I've done some C coding but mostly am a Java an Quiskit coding for quantum computing research.<br>Some projects I worked on are low level assembly games, JavaScript games and Mercuial for FTC</p>
        <p> Another one of my hobbies is baking and cooking, even though as a Junior I dont really have that much time to bake anymore, I was a <strong>fiend</strong> for baking lots of cakes, cookies and pizza. I would go on youtube and watch as much videos as I can about baking over Covid<p> <br>I think thats what kept me somewhat sane </p> 
        <p> I love building things for fun, truly I am an engineer at heart. My favorite thing I built was thanos hands out of computer parts back in August during down time at my tech repair job</p>
        <h2>Thats all (for now)</h2>
